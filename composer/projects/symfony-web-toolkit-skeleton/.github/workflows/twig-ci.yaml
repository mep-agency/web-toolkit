# !!! WARNING !!!
# This file uses reusable GitHub workflows directly from a repository managed by the MEP Agency team.
# While this feature is extremely convenient to keep all your workflows up-to-date automatically, you may prefer to
# clone the "mep-agency/web-toolkit-workflows" repo and manage it manually for stronger security.
#
# Feel free to choose the best option according to your security needs.
